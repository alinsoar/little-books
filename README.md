Here are my solutions to the problems from the following books and articles of Daniel Friedman


The Little Schemer
The Seasoned Schemer
A Little Java
The Little MLer
The Reasoned Schemer
The Little Prover
The Little Monad

Concepts of these books are taught by Daniel Friedman in his courses
at Indiana.  Comparing with SICP, his books always finish with a
metacircular implementation of the system, not with an implementation
in assembler and hardware datapath and control, as SICP does.
