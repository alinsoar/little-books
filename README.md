Here are my solutions to the problems from the following books and articles of Daniel Friedman

```
The Little Schemer
The Seasoned Schemer
A Little Java
The Little MLer
The Reasoned Schemer
The Little Prover
The Little Monad
```

Many concepts from these books are taught by Daniel Friedman in his courses at Indiana.  His books always finish with a metacircular implementation of the system, in contrast with SICP, which comes to the hardware datapath, control, and assembly associated with the corresponding SECD machine.
